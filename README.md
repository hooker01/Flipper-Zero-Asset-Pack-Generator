Flipper Zero Asset Pack Generator
This project provides a Python-based tool for creating and packing animation asset packs for the Flipper Zero device. It consists of two main scripts:

AssetGenerator.py: A Tkinter-based GUI for selecting PNG frames or ZIP files, configuring animation parameters, and generating asset packs.
asset_packer.py: A script for processing and packing animations, icons, and fonts into a Flipper Zero-compatible format, including PNG-to-BM conversion and Heatshrink compression.

Features

User-friendly GUI for input selection (directory or ZIP) and parameter configuration.
Supports renaming and organizing PNG frames for animations.
Generates meta.txt and manifest.txt files with customizable parameters (e.g., frame rate, resolution, butthurt, level, weight).
Converts PNG frames to BM format and applies Heatshrink compression.
Packs animations, static/animated icons, and fonts into a structured asset pack.
Saves output to a user-specified directory.

Prerequisites
To run this project, you need:

Python 3.8+ installed on your system.
The following Python packages:
tkinter (usually included with Python; install python3-tk on Linux if missing)
Pillow (for image processing)
heatshrink2 (for compression)


A set of PNG files named in the format frame_X_delay-*.png (for animations) or a ZIP file containing such files.

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flipper-asset-pack-generator.git
cd flipper-asset-pack-generator


Install Dependencies:Install the required Python packages using pip:
pip install Pillow heatshrink2


Verify Tkinter:Ensure Tkinter is available. On Linux, you may need:
sudo apt-get install python3-tk



Usage

Run the GUI:Start the asset generator by running:
python AssetGenerator.py


Select a directory containing PNG frames or a ZIP file with frames.
Enter animation parameters (e.g., pack name, animation name, frame rate, resolution).
Click "Generate" to process the frames and create an asset pack.
Choose a directory to save the final asset_packs folder.


Run the Packer Script (Optional):To manually pack assets in a directory, run:
python asset_packer.py


The script scans subfolders for assets (animations, icons, fonts) and packs them into an asset_packs folder.
Press Enter to start and exit the script.



File Structure

Input:

PNG files should follow the naming convention frame_X_delay-*.png (e.g., frame_0_delay-0.1s.png).
ZIP files should contain these PNGs in the root or a subdirectory.
Optional: Folders for icons (Icons/) or fonts (Fonts/) in the input directory.


Output:The generated asset_packs folder has the following structure:
asset_packs/
└── <PackName>/
    ├── Anims/
    │   ├── manifest.txt
    │   └── <AnimationName>/
    │       ├── meta.txt
    │       ├── frame_0.png
    │       └── ...
    ├── Icons/ (optional)
    └── Fonts/ (optional)



Parameters
When using the GUI, you can configure:

Pack Name: Name of the asset pack (e.g., MyPack).
Animation Name: Name of the animation (e.g., MyAnim).
Min/Max Butthurt: Range for Flipper Zero's "butthurt" metric (0–18).
Min/Max Level: Level range for the animation (1–30).
Weight: Animation weight (e.g., 3).
Width/Height: Frame resolution (e.g., 128x64).
Frame Rate: Frames per second (e.g., 8).
Duration: Total animation duration in frames (e.g., 3600).

Notes

Ensure PNG files are properly formatted and named to avoid processing errors.
The asset_packer.py script supports additional asset types (icons, fonts), but the GUI focuses on animations.
Temporary files from ZIP extraction are automatically cleaned up.
If the output directory already contains an asset_packs folder, it will be overwritten.

Troubleshooting

"No PNG files to rename": Ensure the input directory or ZIP contains PNGs with the correct naming convention.
"All parameters must be numbers": Verify that numeric fields (e.g., frame rate, width) contain valid integers.
Tkinter not found: Install python3-tk (Linux) or ensure Python includes Tkinter.
Heatshrink2 errors: Confirm the heatshrink2 package is installed (pip install heatshrink2).

Feel free to submit issues or pull requests for bug fixes, new features, or improvements. Ensure any changes are tested and compatible with Python 3.8+.
